*Nice!* Seems like you've successfully registered as a user — now I can finally be your personal buddy!
In short, here’s what I can do for you 👇


📅 *EVENTS*   
 “Add meeting with Sarah *tomorrow at 3pm*”  
 “Schedule gym session *on 10/10 at 8am*”  


⏰ *REMINDERS*   
 “Remind me *in 2 hours* to call mum”  
 “Remind me *30 mins before my flight*”  
 “Remind me *tomorrow 9am* to send report”  

You’ll get a WhatsApp reminder when it’s time 💬  
💡 *Best tip:* use reminders for things within *24 hours*, but use *events* for anything that is more than 24 hours.  


📝 *TASKS (To-do List)*  
 “Add task to *buy groceries*”  
 “Show all pending tasks”  
 “Mark ‘buy groceries’ as done”  

I sort tasks by priority:  
🔴 *High* | 🟡 *Medium* | 🟢 *Low*  


🗒 *NOTES*  
 When you send long texts, I’ll ask if you want to save it as a note.  
 I’ll always confirm before saving — like:  
💬 “Save this as a note?” → just reply *yes* to confirm ✅  

When you want to find something, just say what it’s about —  
I’ll look for the *most related note* for you 🔍  


🕗 *DAILY BRIEFS*
 I’ll automatically send you summaries twice a day:

 *Morning Brief — 8:30 AM*
→ I’ll send your tasks and events for today so you know what’s ahead.
 *Evening Brief — 7:30 PM*
→ I’ll show your remaining tasks and tomorrow’s events, so you can plan ahead calmly before bed.


⚙ *QUICK TIPS*  
• I understand natural time like “in 3 hours” or “next Monday 9am”.  
• If you don’t specify a time, I’ll ask if it’s an all-day thing.  
• I don’t process images or files yet 
• You can talk to me casually — I keep things light but *get work done*
