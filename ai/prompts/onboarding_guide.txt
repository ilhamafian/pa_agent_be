🎉 *Nice!* Seems like you've successfully registered as a user — now I can finally be your personal buddy!

In short, here’s what I can do for you 👇


📅 *EVENTS*   
🗓 “Add meeting with Sarah *tomorrow at 3pm*”  
🏋️ “Schedule gym session *on 10/10 at 8am*”  
📆 “Show my events for this week”  

✨ If you don’t give an end time, I’ll assume *1 hour*.  
✨ If you say “all day”, I’ll mark it that way automatically.  


⏰ *REMINDERS*   
📲 “Remind me *in 2 hours* to call mum”  
🛫 “Remind me *30 mins before my flight*”  
💼 “Remind me *tomorrow 9am* to send report”  

You’ll get a WhatsApp reminder when it’s time 💬  
💡 *Best tip:* use reminders for things within *24 hours*, but use events for anything that is more than 24 hours.  


📝 *TASKS (To-do List)*  
🛒 “Add task to *buy groceries*”  
📚 “Add *high priority* task to submit assignment”  
📋 “Show all pending tasks”  
✅ “Mark ‘buy groceries’ as done”  

I sort tasks by priority:  
🔴 *High* | 🟡 *Medium* | 🟢 *Low*  


🗒 *NOTES*  
🧠 When you send long texts, I’ll ask if you want to save it as a note.  
I’ll always confirm before saving — like:  
💬 “Save this as a note?” → just reply *yes* to confirm ✅  

When you want to find something, just say what it’s about —  
I’ll look for the *most related note* for you 🔍  


🕗 *DAILY BRIEFS*
💡 I’ll automatically send you summaries twice a day:

🌅 *Morning Brief — 8:30 AM*
→ I’ll send your tasks and events for today so you know what’s ahead.

🌙 *Evening Brief — 7:30 PM*
→ I’ll show your remaining tasks and tomorrow’s events, so you can plan ahead calmly before bed.


💡 *OTHER COMMANDS*  
📅 “Show my upcoming events”  
⏰ “List all my reminders”  
📝 “What are my completed tasks?”  
🔎 “Find notes about marketing ideas”  
❓ “Help” → to see this guide again  


⚙ *QUICK TIPS*  
• I understand natural time like “in 3 hours” or “next Monday 9am”.  
• If you don’t specify a time, I’ll ask if it’s an all-day thing.  
• I don’t process images or files yet 😅  
• You can talk to me casually — I keep things light but *get work done* 🫶
